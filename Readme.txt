Please create a directory with your Group Member names. You should have a press release - ideally in HTML, but if you do not know HTML, it can be Word or LaTeX with a link to your video and an image of your prototype. 

The video should be no longer than 1 minute long where you discuss the problem you are addressing and how this novel Arduino product solves that problem.
