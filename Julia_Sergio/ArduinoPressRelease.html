    A Lilypad Arduino is an easy to use piece of hardware that <br> 
    contains input sensors and output pins that allow the user <br> 
    to play music, see lights, and interact with different sensors. <br>
    Lilypad Arduion's are a highly useful piece of technology that are <br>
    becoming more and more prominent within the health community <br>
    because of their uses for people of all ages to help with many <br>
    different health related needs. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This summer at Indiana University-Bloomington a small <br> group of 
    REU students funded by the National Science Foundation <br> 
    (NSF) performed a simple task with Lilypad <br>
    Arduino's. This task was aimed at teaching the students to work <br> 
    with Lilypad Arduino's both software and hardware.
    <br>
    <br>
    The ProHealth REU team of Sergio Ramirez Martin and Julia Dunbar <br> 
    decided to implement the Harry Potter theme song provided by graduate <br> 
    student Ben Jelen with their LilyPad Arduino. These REU students <br>
    complemented the song with RGB light values that are triggered depending <br>
    by the frequency detected by the light sensor. They also decided to add a <br>
    few led lights to further accompany the theme song and other features. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>"I have never worked with a Lilypad Ardunio before and although it <br> 
    took a little bit of a learning curve I enjoyed the outcome that we <br>
    received and I think they would be fun to work with in the future," <br>
    </em>said REU student Dunbar. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <em>"I can't wait to see all that we will be able to do with the <br>
    Lilypad Arduino in the REU Program,"</em> said REU student Ramirez Martin. 
    <br>
    <br>
    For both students it's been an exciting first experience wokring with <br>
    a Lilypad Arduino. They were able to use their programming skills to help <br>
    them figure out the best way to accomplish their goal and also enjoyed <br>
    learning a new tool along the way. They hope to keep making progress and <br>
    coming with new and exciting ways to use Lilypad Arduino's to help those in need.
